<h2> What are stocks?</h2> 
<!-- First section talking about basic info-->

<p> Stocks are parts of large multimillion, billion and sometime trillion dollar companies. When you buy a share of a stock you are buying a small part of a corporation, and as the company grows the share value increases and you can sell for a profit. You can buy and sell shares through a broker such as Charle Schwab, TD Ameritrade, or Robinhood(lots of drama).   </p>

<h2> Risk and Volatility</h2> 
<!-- Defining volatility and explaining the risk that comes with stocks-->

<p> The market can be extremely risky and volatile at times. Market corrections and crashes are healthy and part of the long term success of the stock market. Although, the broad market generally goes up in the long term, the same cannot be said for individual stocks which makes them much riskier. Volatility is how much a security is moving either up or down. There are times when the overall market is very volatile and times where it is stable and only a select few stocks are considered volatle. </p>
